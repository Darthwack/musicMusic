Their poetry emphasizes foolhardiness, and their soulful harmonies carry far.

(4, 'P!NK', 'Although initially viewed as another face in the late-''90s crowd of teen pop acts, Pink (professionally known as P!nk) quickly transcended and outgrew that label with her combination of pop songcraft and powerhouse, rock-influenced vocals. Born Alecia Moore on September 8, 1979, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, Pink received her nickname as a child, years before she dyed her hair accordingly. She grew up in a musical family and was a regular on the Philadelphia club scene by the age of 13, first as a dancer and then as a backing vocalist for the local hip-hop group Schoolz of Thought. At 14, she began writing her own songs; the same year, a local DJ at Club Fever began inviting her on-stage to sing a song every Friday.\r\n\r\nPink was spotted one night by an executive for MCA Records, who asked her to audition for an R&B group called Basic Instinct. Although Pink''s strong vocals landed her the gig, the group imploded not long after. She was quickly recruited for a female R&B trio called Choice, who signed to L.A. Reid and Babyface''s LaFace label on the strength of their demo; however, they too disbanded due to differences over musical direction. During Choice''s brief studio time, producer Daryl Simmons asked Pink to write a bridge section for the song "Just to Be Loving You." Impressed with the results, Pink rediscovered her songwriting muse, and an equally impressed L.A. Reid soon gave her a solo deal with LaFace.\r\n\r\nPink recorded her solo debut, Can''t Take Me Home, with a variety of songwriting partners and dance-pop and R&B producers. Released in 2000, the album was a double-platinum hit; it spun off three Top Ten singles in "There U Go," "Most Girls," and "You Make Me Sick." She toured that summer as the opening act for *N Sync, but soon found herself tired of being pigeonholed as strictly a teen act despite her sassy, forthright persona. As she set about working on her follow-up album, Pink took part in the remake of Patti LaBelle''s "Lady Marmalade" featured on the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, which also featured powerhouse divas Christina Aguilera, Mya, and Lil'' Kim. The song was a massive hit, topping the charts in both the U.S. and U.K. while expanding Pink''s own audience.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the year, Pink released her next single, "Get the Party Started," which climbed into the Top Five and became the singer''s most inescapable hit to date. Her accompanying sophomore album, M!ssundaztood, quickly went double platinum; it boasted a more personal voice and an eclectic sound, plus heavy contributions from ex-4 Non Blondes singer Linda Perry, who helped bring some more rock muscle to Pink''s sound (as did guest appearances by Steven Tyler and Richie Sambora). M!ssundaztood attracted positive critical notices as well, and its second single, "Don''t Let Me Get Me," became another fast-rising Top Ten hit.\r\n\r\nPink next issued Try This in November 2003. The album continued her progression toward more rock-oriented material, due in part to the songwriting collaboration of Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong on eight of the album''s tracks. Try This'' lead single, "Trouble," cracked the upper regions of Billboard''s Top 40 and earned Pink a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. On the home front, Pink wed motocross racer Carey Hart -- whom she had initially met at 2001''s X-Games -- on January 7, 2006, in Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nHer next album, I''m Not Dead, appeared that April; its first single, "Stupid Girls," quickly became a hit, while "Who Knew" and "U + Ur Hand" both cracked the Top Ten. I''m Not Dead reached platinum status in several countries and helped ramp up anticipation for Pink''s follow-up, Funhouse, which arrived in October 2008. "So What," the album''s leadoff single, became her first number one hit since "Lady Marmalade." Another hit, "Please Don''t Leave Me," followed in 2009 and all her hits were collected on the 2010 release Greatest Hits...So Far!!!, which was preceded by the single "Raise Your Glass." Around the time of the release of Greatest Hits...So Far!!! Pink announced that she and her husband were expecting their first child.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Pink released her sixth studio album, The Truth About Love. With production from Greg Kurstin, Butch Walker, Max Martin, Dan Wilson, and others, the album featured such singles as "Blow Me (One Last Kiss)" and "Try."', 'pink.jpg', 'http://www.pinkspage.com/us/home'),
(5, 'The Kin', 'One night a little over a year ago, three young men burst into New York City''s Lower East Side mainstay, Katz''s Delicatessen, and held the joint up. Sort of. HIJACK and THORALD, along with drummer SHAKERLEG, make up New York City band The Kin, were looking to rob ears, not wallets.\r\n\r\n"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a musical robbery!" shouted Hijack as he strode in with Thorald on his heels strumming a guitar. The duo launched into an original song, "Downtown Train" for the restaurant''s patrons, winning them over with their energetic performance, rich harmonies, and sheer nerve.\r\n\r\nThe Kin have launched several of these "musical robberies," including at the Sundance Film Festival, SXSW, Soho House, and Seven Grand Whiskey Bar in Los Angeles, even at a French airport. "We''re looking to surprise people and give them a musical experience," Isaac says. "Even if it''s just for a split second, it''s a rush for everyone involved."\r\n\r\nThe Kin have been capturing their gritty ''danger-pop'' sound in the studio, working with legendary producer Tony Visconti (best known for his work with David Bowie and T. Rex), as well as former Record Plant staff engineer Jack Douglas (John Lennon, Aerosmith) and Nic Hard (Joey Ramone, The Church) to record the songs that will make up the band''s major-label debut album to be released by Interscope later this year, which will include the single ''On the Rise.''\r\n\r\nThe question was: How do you bring to life something that is so explosive live? One way has been to showcase not only Hijack and Thorald''s dual lead vocals and familial harmonies, but also the raw power of Shakerleg''s stick-free, bare-knuckle percussive stylings which the Buffalo, NY-native honed through years of trying to get the attention of apathetic commuters while performing on NYC subway platforms before he agreed to join The Kin.\r\n\r\n"I don''t think we truly became The Kin until Shakerleg joined. For the six years before that, we played with great musicians but it always felt like we were putting together an ensemble. Now it makes sense."\r\n\r\nThis year, The Kin will continue to play live as they finish up recording their upcoming album. "So much has been done before but you try to reach into your own heart and hear the music in there. That''s the place I like to write from."', 'the_kin.jpg', 'http://thekin.com/'),
(6, 'James Armstrong', 'Guitarist, singer and songwriter James Armstrong was born to play the blues. His mother was a blues singer. His father played jazz guitar. Born in Los Angeles, California, Armstrong formed his first band in the seventh grade and by the age of 17 he was touring the country. Today he travels the world and continues to infuse his voice and guitar playing with his unique personality and seasoned skills.\r\n\r\nIn his twenties James was the youngest guitar player to play in Smokey Wilson''s legendary band. James also helped form a band in Southern California called Mama Roo. That collaboration resulted in an album of the same name, and his first recording contract with Crescendo Records.\r\nIn the early 90''s James got plenty of exposure to his musical influences, including Albert Collins, who spent quality time with James and taught him a few tricks. Shortly after that he was discovered and signed by HighTone Records while playing in a Santa Monica bar, later immortalized in his song Mr.B''s.\r\n\r\nThen, just as he was about to tour with his critically acclaimed first album Sleeping With A Stranger, tragedy struck. The events surrounding a home invasion left Armstrong without the use of his left hand and arm, including permanent nerve damage. This threatened to end his career forever. But, thanks to the support of friends, fans and the blues community Armstrong came back two years later with a second album, Dark Night.\r\n\r\nWhat Armstrong lost in the tragedy he gained in "a whole new respect for the music itself, the power in slow blues, how the silences between the notes are as important as the notes". Armstrong also turned his efforts to perfecting his songwriting, vocal and slide guitar skills, all the while developing his gift for turning hardship into song. The results were a third album, Got It Goin'' On. The CD garnered two WC Handy award nominations for best blues guitarist and for best song of the year with Pennies and Picks. The CD, Got It Goin'' On, with its new grooves and surprises, was praised by critics for its part in redefining the blues and keeping the genre alive.\r\n\r\nOver the years Armstrong has performed in many countries including North America, Europe, Scandinavia, Asia and the Middle East. He has worked beside Albert Collins, Keb Mo, Coco Montoya, Tommy Castro, Roy Brown, Shemekia Copeland, Chaka Khan, Charlie Musselwhite, Ricky Lee Jones, Joe Louis Walker, Mitch Michell (Jimi Hendrix''s drummer), Peter Tork (The Monkees), Jan & Dean, just to name a few.\r\n\r\nJames skill as a performer has not gone unnoticed by filmmakers. Several of his songs have been chosen for movie soundtracks. Bank of Love was used in Hear No Evil, with Martin Sheen and Marlie Matlin. Two Sides to Every Story is featured in Speechles with Micheal Keaton and Geena Davis also in The Florentine with Jeremy Davies and Luke Perry.\r\n\r\nArmstrong''s latest release Blues at the Border, recorded in New York and Texas for his new label, Cat Food Records, manages to honor the sound of traditional blues while giving it the contemporary grit his fans have grown accustomed to hearing from James. Instead of buckling under the pressures of being a touring bluesman in the 21st century, he''s made them the topic of many of the songs on his much awaited new album. While economic hard times and a climate of fear after 9-11 have ended many careers in the industry, James is not a stranger to hardship. "As a survivor of a violent home invasion, I''ve always known that life is not about how many times you fall but how many times you get back up. I wanted to make an album to reflect how much the world has changed." Producers Michael Ross, Bob Trenchard, and Armstrong went with Blues at the Border as the title cut to illustrate James'' point. The song reflects a 21st century frustration when crossing borders.\r\nYoung Man with the Blues is his most autobiographical song to date. It pays tribute to James'' father, a musician himself who gave James the gift of music, a love of the road and, despite the absence of a mother, a happy childhood.\r\n"Young Man With The Blues surely has to be the best original blues song written this year... an absolute gem!"\r\n—Amazon.com\r\n\r\nBy drawing on his rock, country and folk influences as well as his deep blues roots, Blues At the Border manages to transcend the constraints of tight musical boundaries. "The blues is evolving like every other genre" he says. "You can be authentic and contemporary at the same time. It''s all about balance" It is evident that James'' years of heavy touring have honed his skill and unique style.\r\nJim DeKoster of Living Blues Magazine states, "Likely one of the year''s best, and not to be missed".\r\n\r\nSeen live, Armstrong has a confident stage presence that combines grace with mischief. Few blues artists know how to play the crowd as James can, shifting dynamics from a whisper to a growl. Wherever he travels around the world his magnetism continues to hush a noisy rabble or entice a crowd to follow him out into the street or down the length of a beach. Little wonder he''s been dubbed: The Ambassador of the Blues', 'James_Armstrong.jpg', 'http://jarmblues.com/press.html'),
(7, 'Craig Campbell', 'Pure, True, Country If you want it, go and get it. That is the sentiment that has driven Craig Campbell throughout his life and the one that has landed him a contract with Bigger Picture Group, one of today''s hottest new music companies. Armed with a solid grasp on his desire to make it in country music, he loaded up his dreams and headed north to Nashville from his South Georgia hometown of Lyons with miles of music behind him and many more ahead. He is an authentic country singer/songwriter that will bring tried and true tradition back to the forefront.\r\n\r\nLike many country artists, Campbell began singing at an early age. He started playing piano at 7, providing music for his church until graduating from high school. During this time, he was a two-time local winner of the national Jimmy Dean/True Value Country Showdown at ages 15 and 18 respectively, after the loss of his father from colon cancer and his sister''s sudden death a few years later. It was his sister who helped him pick the songs and pushed him to enter the Country Showdown. Obviously shattered by these unprecedented circumstances at such a young age, one might want to just crawl into a hole, but Campbell put his best foot forward and grabbed his determination and moved through it. "This was a very trying time for me and I felt that if I didn''t follow through with my music, I might not be here today," says Campbell.\r\n\r\nUpon graduation, he took a job with the Georgia Department of Corrections – but quickly resigned to play music full-time. He started his band - Out of the Blue - with a good friend in 1999, playing juke joints throughout South Georgia while holding down a house band gig at a club in his hometown. Not wanting to be a cover band, they disbanded and he headed to Nashville in 2002 and later joined Tracy Byrd''s band playing piano in 2005, marrying Mindy Ellis and starting a family.\r\n\r\n"I knew I needed to play my own music and be seen. So, I went down to Lower Broadway in Nashville and scored a residency at The Stage," he says. "This was perfect. I was developing a fan base with the customers and more importantly some of the staff. The Stage''s manager Kim Trosdahl was tenacious in her desire to have people come and see me. She got BPG''s Michael Powers down to see me. His excitement kept growing and he told me ‘I get more impressed each time I see you and I am going to bring Keith down''." In August of 2008, Keith Stegall made it to The Stage, found the excitement Powers was preaching and invited Campbell to drop by the office. Within three days of meeting Keith, Craig was doing demos for his publishing company.\r\n\r\nThis relationship grew, but was just that, a relationship and confidence builder for Campbell as the company was diligently ramping up to open their offices. "When Keith said ‘be patient'', I got it, but it was hard," says Campbell. "But, in 2009, I was officially offered a partnership with BPG and immediately began writing for the publishing company and working on putting my record together. To me, my style of music and Stegall are the perfect musical match. And then when I got to know him, it was all over, we just gelled."\r\n\r\nCampbell hooks you right in from the first note. With his convincing and deeply strong baritone, his debut single "Family Man" is an ode to his nature and his future. Currently, performing at The Stage and spending time traveling from coast to coast introducing himself and his music is keeping him busy this summer as he gears up for his upcoming tour.\r\n\r\nHe is impacting the charts early, his five-song digital EP has already been TOP 20 on ITUNES and he is just getting started. His full length release is forthcoming and will include the "best of the crop" of Campbell-penned tunes.\r\n\r\nCraig Campbell is a true country artist, inspired by many, yet forging his own brand of music that should become a mainstay on the country charts. "I am a big fan of the ‘Class of ''89'' which includes Clint Black, Shenandoah and Alan Jackson. So, to have Keith as my producer after hearing all of those Jackson classics; is something that makes me pinch myself daily," says Campbell.', 'craig_campbell.jpg', 'http://craigcampbell.tv/'),

(10, 'My Yellow Rickshaw', 'Inevitably, the  first question that is asked when the band meets new people is, ''So where''d ya get the name My Yellow Rickshaw?''  Like most stories, the tale is a long and fascinating one.  My Yellow Rickshaw''s beginning goes back to 1991.  The three original members of the band (Nathan Klatt, Eric Maitlen, and Steve Hueber) grew up together on a country road, quietly nestled outside the small town of Portland, Indiana.  When one grows up next to a limestone quarry (watch out for the dynamite explosions) and an ostrich farm (yes, ostriches!), options are somewhat limited.\r\n\r\nThank you Jesus for music!  Through high school and the college years Nathan, Eric, and Steve spent waaaayyyy too many hours jamming together in neighborhood garages, alcohol-soaked fraternity rooms, and church basements, playing mediocre to downright atrocious versions of their favorite mainstream and worship songs.  No official band was ever put together in those years -- it was simply a group of friends who were like brothers, using music to find joy, inspiration and humor with each other, and anyone who would listen (or who was unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity).  After school, the boys went their separate ways -- Nathan to social work and later to full-time playing music, Eric into full-time musician/mission work with his spirited wife Jillian, and Steve, who traveled some with Eric while beginning work in the computer programming field, while continuing to be extremely handsome.\r\n\r\nIn early 2009, after being apart for about five years, a series of "coincidental circumstances"  brought the three gents back together again.  Nathan had quit playing professionally, and was doing social work in the Indianapolis area.  Eric and his wife Jillian had come off the road after 5 intense years doing stateside and world-wide "musicianary" trips, and needed some time to recharge/recoop their energies and passions.  Steve was also in the Indianapolis area, working as a full-time computer systems analyst (whatever that means).  The three started hanging out together again, catching up on each other''s lives and directions for the past few years, and of course, music was always part of the time spent together.\r\n\r\nAfter hanging out together a few times and jamming, the idea just popped up: why not put a trio together, play some fun tunes for folks, weave humor, music, and story-telling together, and make the focus of the band about joy and celebration?  Everything sounded good, and plans were put into motion, except for one tiny but important conundrum -- what to call the band . . . . . which brings us back full circle.  After kicking around many ridiculous ideas, the band came up with the name My Yellow Rickshaw.  The name gets its origin from one of Eric and Steve''s musicianary trips; while spending an extended period of time in India, Eric and Steve befriended a rickshaw driver named Gopal Singh, who drove a yellow rickshaw for a living.  It is quite a bizarre story, but absolutely true -- hence the name, goofiness, and overall sense of joy/happiness that exudes from the band.  \r\n\r\nAs 2009 progressed and the band was blessed to play more shows, My Yellow Rickshaw realized they needed to expand by adding a drummer.  Through some family and friends, the band was introduced to Jeremy Lee, and it is safe to say that Jeremy was the right choice.  Jeremy''s metronome-like precision, solid grooves, and light-bulb smile/personality make him the perfect man anchoring the sound and rhythm of My Yellow Rickshaw.  As 2010 came and went, the band added bassist Cory Carleton.  Cory and Nathan had spent the last 8 years playing and traveling together in several bands.  Cory''s infectious and melodic bass lines are well respected around the Indianapolis area.  His professional decorum is second-to-none, and he might just be the sweetest man this side of Mr. Rogers.\r\n\r\nThe band functioned as a five-piece until July 2011, as Steve was forced to take his talents (and djembe) to Orange County, California.  Somehow, a prestigious computer software company was able to pay him more than the princely salary offered to him by MYR.  While Steve may be not be here in person, his spirit and quirkiness that helped start the band lives on in the unique humor and banter that is typical of a MYR show. \r\n\r\nAs 2012 loomed on the horizon, the need arose to find more players/personalities, as the band''s increasingly demanding schedule neccesitated time off and space for the members various callings/interests.  Enter Rick and his spectacular shock of "faux-''fro" red hair -- he played his first show in March 2012 (at a wedding, no less) while Eric was in Jamaica.  Rick''s jovial spirit, dry sense of humor, and complete lack of knowledge following sports truly make him the perfect heir to Eric, when Eric''s talents are not available.   The lingering question that''s on everyone''s minds is -- are Rick and Nathan brothers?  Are they cousins?  Are they not related at all?  Depends on what Rickshaw fan you ask.  We''ll never tell, it''s more fun that way :)  The fall of 2012 brought Ryan "Fitzy" Fitzpatrick into the fray.  Fresh off the road from the exciting world of semi-driving, Eric and Fitzy had played together as far back as 2005, so the chemistry was an easy fit.  When Jeremy is not available, Fitzy''s precise playing and big "drum pocket" keeps folks dancing all night.  In fact, the MYR players often can''t tell a difference between Jeremy and Fitzy, their playing styles are so close and consistent to each other.  Yes, Rick and Fitzy are officially part of the MYR mafia (they both recently received their special band tatoos - don''t ask), and you will see them around plenty. \r\n\r\nAs 2013 is moving along, the band continues to play on a rigorous schedule, at a variety of events and locations.  While seasons come and go, players may leave or return, and success may ebb and flow, the band will staunchly stick to its grassroots beginnings and principles:  1.  humor and fun music  2.  always bring the "Joy-factor"  3.

Some music is so original it seems snatched from the great, invisible substrata that runs below all human activity, a sound aching to be born without a flag or fixed allegiance – free, questing, overflowing with immediate, tangible life. This is the music of Toubab Krewe, the vibrant Asheville, NC-based instrumental powerhouse that creates a sonic Pangaea that lustily swirls together rock, African traditions, jam sensibilities, international folk strains and more. While nearly impossible to put into any box, it takes only a few moments to realize in a very palpable way that one is face-to-face with a true original who recognizes no borders in a march towards a muscular, original, globally switched-on sound.\r\n\r\nFormed in 2005, Toubab Krewe has tenaciously honed their craft through relentless touring and a fierce dedication to carving out something they can truly call their own. The fruits of this hard work can be heard on their latest release, TK2, (September 7, 2010 on Nat Geo Music). What Justin Perkins (Kora, Kamelngoni, guitar, percussion), Vic Stafford (drums, congas), Drew Heller (guitar, piano, fiddle), David Pransky (bass, guitar), and Luke Quaranta (Djembe, percussion) have wrought on TK2 reflects the many miles and musical journeys that have transpired since their studio debut.\r\n\r\nThis is a band that actively draws inspiration from whatever source floats into their purview, something they''ve exhibited in their half decade of heavy gigging, including regular appearances at major U. S. festivals like Bonnaroo, High Sierra, Rothbury and Wakarusa, and abroad at such legendary gatherings as Festival In The Desert in Mali. Their globe-hopping propensity has made them an emerging headliner at their hometown''s famous Orange Peel and a familiar face as similar venues throughout the country. Whether on their own or collaborating with luminaries like the Last Poets'' Umar Bin Hassan or Uncle Earl''s Rayna Gellert, Toubab Krewe has already earned the attention and respect of a broad musical community.\r\n\r\nToubab carries echoes of African greats like Ali Farka Toure, Orchestra Baobab and Salif Keita, no doubt picked up during the group''s travels to study and live in Guinea, Ivory Coast and Mali. But what truly differentiates Toubab Krewe from other Statesiders inspired by African music is how they innovate on what they''ve learned instead of simply recreating tradition. Toubab Krewe carves out a new trail honoring the African originators they admire by making something alive and contemporary.', 'toubab_krewe.jpg', 'http://www.toubabkrewe.com/'),

Accident, inevitability, chance, fate no one will ever be able to explain whatever it is that draws the colors of a rainbow together into one stream of pure white light. Green River Ordinance was born from this light. Brothers Geoff and Jamey Ice, Josh Jenkins, Joshua Wilkerson and Denton Hunker joined their lives together into one singular dream. The dream of creating music. While most kids their age were worrying about entering high school, they were writing and performing their own music.

Soon after meeting Clifford, Clark began to play with an array of musical icons, including Vaughan, who, among Vaughan and others in the Austin music community helped Clark along his musical path, facilitating his ascent in the Texas rock & roll scene. Today, Clark is one of the many black musicians in rock & roll who are resurrecting the blues for a mdern-day audience. Critics claim his music highlights how the influence of rock and roll and the blues have ubiquitously shaped virtually every medium of music over the past century, ranging from hip-hop to country music.\r\n\r\nRolling Stone declared Clark "Best Young Gun" in its April 2011 "Best of Rock" issue and ranked Clark''s "Bright Lights" EP at No. 40 on its list of 2011''s top 50 albums. Last November, Clark was also named SPIN magazine''s breakout artist. In early 2012, Clark sang on the bonus track cover of "I Want You Back," by the Jackson 5, featured on Sheryl Crow ''s new album, "100 Miles from Memphis." In 2010, He was a featured performer at the Crossroads Guitar Festival, alongside legendary artists such as B. B. King, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Steve Winwood, John Mayer, Crow, Jeff Beck, and ZZ Top.', 'gary_clark.jpg', 'http://www.garyclarkjr.com/2013falltour'),

(18, 'Cameron McGill & What Army', 'Born in 1877 in Calw, on the edge of the Black Forest, Cameron McGill was brought up in a missionary household where it was assumed that he would study for the ministry. McGill''s religious crisis led to his fleeing from the Maulbronn seminary in 1891, an unsuccessful cure by a well-known theologian and faith healer, and an attempted suicide. After being expelled from high school, he worked in bookshops for several years--not an unusual occupation for dismissed Chicago songwriters.\r\n\r\nHis first album, Stories of The Knife and The Back (2004), describes a youth who leaves his mountain village to become a poet. The lush instrumentation and beautifully crafted melodies, belie the dark nature of the song content. Mostly focusing on personal admissions of guilt and failure, the album''s characters struggle with coming to terms with mortality. All throughout, they simply try to find a friend and fall in love.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by Street Ballads & Murderesques (2006), the tale of a schoolboy totally out of touch with his contemporaries, who flees through different cities after his escape from home. The collection of songs on Streets ...takes pop music to the dark libraries of your old house, inhabits a stark and desperate corner of the mind, and simply tells a good story. The wildly vibrant characters offer their most honest interpretations of their understanding of life. They travel time, they fall in and out of love, they miss and are missed. These are songs of imminent regret, class IV rapids, European gypsies, pre-renaissance Germany, cities with chips on their shoulder, veterans of domestic war, handwritten letters and handmade harmony, foreign wines and local girls, break-ups and breakdowns, and post-war divorcees.\r\n\r\nWorld War I came as a terrific shock, and McGill joined the pacifist Romain Rolland in antiwar activities--not only writing antiwar songs, but editing two newspapers for prisoners of war. During this period, McGill''s first marriage broke up (reflected in "It''s Not Right" off of Street Ballads & Murderesques ), he studied the works of Freud, eventually underwent analysis with Jung, and was for a time a patient in a sanatorium.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 he moved permanently to Switzerland, and brought out Cameron McGill and What Army, which reflects his preoccupation with the workings of the subconscious and with battles against depression...but mostly focuses on learning how to have fun. His forthcoming ''Hold on Beauty'' LP will be released in late-2007. He never won the Nobel Prize, but his mother always loved him. Until his death in 2056, he lived in seclusion in Illinois.', 'cameron_mcgil.jpg', 'http://cameronmcgill.com/'),
(19, 'Israel Houghton', 'Israel Houghton …changing the world with The Power of One\r\n\r\nSince his humble debut as a recording artist in the `90s, dizzyingly chameleonic Israel Houghton has been injecting contemporary gospel with a blazing, youthful and musically masterful energy that has placed him among the most highly influential tastemakers in his field. As a singer, composer, multi-instrumentalist, producer and worship leader, he has created a canon of songs that have become standards in houses of faith around the globe. He has accomplished this largely as the leader of Israel and New Breed, a GRAMMY®, Stellar and Dove Award-winning musical ensemble and ministry organization that has amassed gold-selling albums and critical platitudes reserved for the best of the best. For his most current musical offering, Israel momentarily steps away from New Breed, whose members are also active in their own ministries, to record a solo album that is his most personal effort to date. The project, Power of One, is a guest-filled tour de force that is galvanizing in both its inspirational power and Israel''s bankable high standard of music making. Power of One is a challenge to all of faith to be as impassioned and Christ-like in their earthly walk as humanly possible. And does "Iz" ever have the soundtrack for that spiritual walk! From roots reggae and head-banging rock to sanctified funk and power pop, Power of One is a visceral rush of bravado and gratitude. Listening to this album - Israel''s first solo studio offering after a string of highly successful New Breed concert sets - will surely set your soul on fire.\r\n\r\n"This is the first time I''ve entered into a project with no premeditation," Israel explains. "In the past, I''d go into a project saying we need this kind of song here and that kind there - worrying if it would sell or if the Church would accept it. This time it was fun to go into creating a record with no rules and just do what was in our hearts...a very cathartic experience." The seeds for Power of One were planted last May at a friend''s beach house in Southern California. "It''s about two miles from where I was born in Carlsbad," says Israel. "I generally go there by myself to gather my thoughts, turn off the phone, read, write and get inspired. This time I had Tommy Sims and Aaron Lindsey come in to give a collective energy try. We had a couple of acoustic guitars, bass, keys, Pro Tools and a digital studio. We spent three days there...just looking at the ocean and writing the bulk of the album.\r\n\r\n"Recalling musical missions past, Israel states, "If you look at our albums thematically, the early ones were about the Church and what God is doing… ‘a New Season is coming'' and ‘Another Level.'' On the most recent records, our message has shifted into more social and global concerns, focusing on identity and the purpose of God in everyone''s life. I strongly believe that those of us who consider ourselves worshippers need to have a heart for social justice. ‘Power of One'' is the song we wrote specifically around that thought for this album."\r\n\r\nBoth instrospective and anthemic, the song "Power of One" is an instant high water mark in a catalog already rich in Israel classics. Interestingly, it wasn''t originally intended to be recorded by Israel at all. He explains, "Two and a half years ago, I was asked to write a song for a mainstream artist who was looking for something based around a socially conscious idea. At that time I was just beginning to understand the connection between worship and justice, so this song came very quickly to me. I was about to send it to the artist''s manager when my wife Meleasa asked me to play it again. When I did, she said, ‘Don''t you dare send that away! The time will soon come for you to sing that song.'' Now is that time."\r\n\r\nAs an album, Power of One overflows with exceptional material, all woven together by mesmerizing interludes. The experience begins with the percussive and grand "Everywhere I Go," a joyous jam about the relationship between The Lord and the faithful. That song and "Moving Forward," are the two tried and tested numbers of the collection as they had already become fan favorites, uplifting worship concert audiences before writing began for the new album. "Just Wanna Say" is a danceable confection reminiscent of OutKast''s "Hey Ya." It''s the infectious rave-fave of Israel''s kids (ages 12, 7 and 5). Another highlight is the powerful gospel ballad "Every Prayer" which features Israel''s old friends Mary Mary.\r\n\r\nLyrically direct and musically dynamic, one of the instant ear grabbers is "You Found Me." "I got the original idea riding a jet ski," Israel confesses. "I was going about 70 miles per hour when the words and melody ‘You Found Me'' just smacked me in the face! Two weeks out from recording, I was playing it on my acoustic and Meleasa loved it. She filled in a lot of the lyrical holes… she''s a genius in painting word pictures. We wrote the chorus together. The last section is a vamp from another song called ‘I Am Free'' from our Sound of The New Breed series - that ‘No more chains holding me'' line fit really well. The song had an Island feel at first, but I''d been listening to some off-the-radar rock groups. Aaron suggested we put the melody over a rockier feel. Within minutes we had a really fun and edgy new thing. So I called (rapper) tobyMac. He loved it and joined me on the song."\r\n\r\nIsrael got to exercise his Reggae muscles elsewhere on "Surely Goodness," which sprang from a series of pan-global happenstances. "Three days before I got to the beach house, I was in Kingston doing an afternoon sound check - just me - playing Crowded House''s ‘Don''t Dream It''s Over'' on my guitar, only more from a reggae standpoint. Next thing I know, I started singing the chorus of what has become ‘Surely Goodness.'' That night I happened to meet (reggae vocal queen) Chevelle Franklin back at the hotel. I was honored. Told her we should do something together and she said she''d love to. We eventually re-connected in South Africa and she cut the final vocals with me. That lady is unbelievable! Our goal was to get some straight authentic Bob Marley from back in the day - old school reggae, no embellishing."\r\n\r\nYet another unforgettable song of Christian conviction from Power of One is "Sing (Redemption Song)" – a mod mash up of Al Green groove and soaring British rock. "It''s rare that I start with just music," he explains of his songwriting process. "Tommy set it off with a guitar idea. We eventually tracked it with a melody but no lyrics and just lived with it for a while. A month later, I got an idea that led to Tommy and me emailing lyric concepts back and forth. I wound up recording my vocal in South Africa with Chevelle as well as Martin Smith (leader of the British Christian rock band Delirious? - forward thinking musical soul mates of New Breed from across the pond)."\r\n\r\nThe difference between Power of One as an Israel solo project vs. New Breed albums is subtle. "Most New Breed albums are done live," Israel states. "This is a studio record so it has a different energy. I get to call on any and everybody for specific sessions. The biggest question is always who''s going to play drums. Tthe first week I used Calvin Rogers. The second week we brought in Dan Needham. And we used Lamar Carter on ‘Saved by Grace.''" That song, reminiscent of the classic live New Year''s Eve video of Prince & The Revolution joining Sheila E.''s band for the encore medley "I Would Die For You/Baby I''m a Star" is an all-out throw down, thundering on for a hair-raising 13 minutes like it''s "1999!" Another special guest on the album is multi-instrumentalist Akil Thompson (son of drum master Chester Thompson from Weather Report and Genesis) who co-wrote "You Are Loved" with Israel. "Akil is a monster on bass, drums and guitar," Israel marvels.\r\n\r\nIsrael Houghton has amassed a legion of followers that crosses generational lines with popularity across African American, Latin and Caucasian listener lines as well. While blasting down barriers,he has been fittingly graced with 2 Gold-selling albums, 6 Dove Awards, 2 Stellar Awards, a Soul Train Award and 2 GRAMMY® Awards – one for "Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album" for A Deeper Level and one for "Best Traditional Gospel Album" for Alive In South Africa. Ironically, there is very little that is "traditional" about Israel''s progressive connection to now-generation believers and the way his music is fanatically embraced around the globe.\r\n\r\nBeyond his solo album, Israel is also a published author with other multi-media projects in the works. As for New Breed, Israel is ever and always connected to them, though the unit is currently preparing a live recording without him. This frees him to pursue a myriad of other exciting opportunities for artistic growth and his own personal sojourn into the Power of One.\r\n\r\n"I really enjoy what I do," Israel concludes. "It''s about getting a bigger picture of what''s going on in the world instead of focusing on my life, wants and needs. It''s about connecting with people around the world."', 'IsraelHoughton.jpg', 'http://integritymusic.com/'),

(21, 'Dangermuffin', 'Five years and four albums into a career that''s found them drawing circles around the lower 48, building a burgeoning national fan base, Dangermuffin embodies a curious paradox. The themes found within their striking new collection, Olly Oxen Free, sum up that juxtaposition.\r\n\r\nThis Folly Beach, S.C.-based trio are clearly at peace with themselves and their career, while keeping up a constant pursuit of truth. The seeds they''ve planted at major festivals around the nation grow as fast as the mileage on their odometer, yet they dream and sing of home with a yearning passion. Most strikingly, the band''s musical execution remains refreshingly simple, belying a staggering lyrical and thematic depth behind each individual song.\r\n\r\nDangermuffin can no longer be plainly dubbed an Americana or roots-rock band. Behind the virtuosic rhythms of drummer Steven Sandifer, the group seamlessly segues from calypso to world beat to a down-home shuffle, often within the same song. When guitarist Mikie Sivilli steps in with a powerful slide-driven lead, one might even venture to call it Southern rock. But by the time songwriter Dan Lotti sings the first words of another verse with his unmistakable light rasp, the listener is undeniably back on the beach, pondering both the world''s pleasures and ills through sandy toes.\r\n\r\nThe follow-up to 2010''s Moonscapes, which produced tracks that received generous airplay on both SiriusXM''s Jam_On and Outlaw Country stations, Olly Oxen Free demonstrates heightened ambitions and a refined, road-polished outfit ready to take on even more. Opener ''Slumber'' greets us with an enveloping sense of hope. The ska beat of ''Battle'' gives way to a fierce guitar solo, before ''200 Degrees'' comes in batting cleanup. The fourth track on the disc, that song''s memorable riff serves as an epic reminder that Dangermuffin has no plans to rest on their laurels.\r\n\r\nOlly Oxen Free never turns its back on the audience for a moment. Recorded at Truphonic Studios in Charleston with producer MJ Fick, even the album''s peaceful acoustic interlude, ''Jaula,'' feels like a breath of fresh ocean air; an unexpected, serene eye of a perfect summer storm.\r\n\r\nFrom ''Homestead'' to ''Rattle the Cage,'' Lotti''s songwriting encourages us to be free, revel in the simple beauty of our complicated lives, and always seek out healing answers. Like the cry bellowed during a children''s game of hide-and-seek, Olly Oxen Free signals that it''s safe to come out from our hiding spots, gather together, and celebrate late into the evening.

(22, 'Big Daddy Love', 'Asheville, North Carolina''s BIG DADDY LOVE brings a unique and natural blend of jam, grass, roots, and rock to the emerging North Carolina music scene. With fiery vocals, sweet-sugary harmonies, authentic song-craft, and undeniable musicianship, the quintet delivers high-energy performances of "Appalachian Rock" - their own brand of good-time music. It is the startling power of these live shows that resonate with audiences and the genuine, intensely personal lyrics of their original songs captivate and convert listeners into passionate fans.\r\n\r\nIn the late Summer of 2009, singer/songwriter Daniel Justin Smith and two of his high school friends from Sparta, NC got together for some casual acoustic pickin'' and realized that something special was happening. This hometown roots collaboration inspired Smith to revamp the band he was already toying around with and Big Daddy Love emerged. Beginning with the core of Alleghany County boys—Smith, Joey Recchio on electric guitar and Brian Swenk on acoustic and electric banjos-- the addition a tight, funk-infused Carolina foothills rhythm (bassist Ashley Sutton and drummer Kelly Linville) sealed the deal. After touring that Fall the new band recorded To The Mountain in January 2010 at the famous Echo Mountain Studios in Asheville, NC.\r\n\r\nTo The Mountain is an album in the truest sense—a carefully crafted journey of songs—that has received emphatic and heartfelt reviews from reviewers throughout the region and far beyond. “…The thing is, this all works together well, and it flows as album — remember those, where all the songs work together to the betterment of the total experience — not just some isolated downloaded track on your playlist. This is a great disc…Give Big Daddy Love the chance and I’ll bet they’ll win you over.” (Gary Hill, Music Street Journal). From across the pond, a reviewer in Belgium wrote “…[if you are] a fan of The Allman Brothers Band or Drive-By Truckers, but you are open to bluegrass elements, then this CD really is a must.” Back home in the mountains, another writer said “From start to finish, To The Mountain is a captivating album that alludes to a dynamic live show. If the musicians dabble in a variety of styles it’s only because, well, they can. And certain elements — a tightly-coiled energy always threatening to explode within each song, a choice group of collaborators, flawless musicianship and Smith’s compelling vocals — provide a palpable thread throughout.” (Alli Marshall, Mountain Xpress). Picked up as a favorite spin by Americana and AAA radio stations throughout the region, including taste-maker WNCW in Spindale, NC, To The Mountain is a snapshot of a young band realizing the power of their vision, stretching the boundaries of their influences while celebrating their Appalachian roots.\r\n\r\nPress is press and praise is praise, but what really make the difference is that on stage Big Daddy Love delivers the goods. After the band’s 2010 Music City Roots performance in Nashville, Jim Lauderdale referred to Big Daddy Love as “Western NC sockin’ it to ya”. Live, with the lights on and the volume up, Big Daddy Love stretches the music out with top notch picking and ripping, delivering a stompin’ good time rich with authentic Carolina soul. The lyrics and the performances themselves are infused with a universally appealing sense of community and spirit-- the essential element of Daniel Smith’s songwriting. This very vibe is the Love that gives name to the group. It is fundamental to the band’s roots in Sparta, NC, a small town in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Smith still works on a family farm in the area when not on the road.\r\n\r\nThe Love Bus, as the fans call themselves, embrace Big Daddy Love’s ‘Appalachian Rock’ as if their own musical heroes had converged in 2009 to create a new band. Fast and powerful as a freight train, Big Daddy Love brings the high energy of Southern rock into the down-home vibe of a mountain bluegrass folk festival. With heavy doses of jam, soul and an electric banjo replacing the second guitar of the traditional Southern rock genre, Big Daddy Love breathes new life into both traditions. Imagine J.D. Crow crossed with the Black Crowes…The Stanley Brothers and The Allman Brothers…what if Led Zeppelin grew up in the Appalachian Mountains on a dairy farm? Big Daddy Love falls into the middle of all these with an undeniably original sound of its own. Experience the love.', 'big_daddy_love', 'http://www.bigdaddylove.net/'),
(23, 'Chris Botti', 'Trumpeter Chris Botti is a gifted instrumentalist, a talented composer, and a charismatic performer who--since the release of his first solo album in 1995--has created a series of recordings that have made him a virtual genre-of-one in the realm of contemporary jazz. Through his singular combination of lush atmos-pheres and thoughtful improvisations, Botti has earned both critical acclaim and mainstream appreciation.\r\n\r\nBotti''s latest album, To Love Again, a collection of pop jazz standards from the acclaimed trumpeter and nine superstar guest vocalists, is a worthy successor to Botti''s last RIAA gold-certified album, When I Fall In Love.\r\n\r\nTo Love Again, which is available as both a traditional CD and as a Dual Disc, showcases Chris Botti''s inimitable velvet tone and sublime trumpet phrasings on 13 newly recorded pop and jazz standards featuring nine stand-out vocal performances by some of the greatest singers in modern pop, jazz, and rock. After the first week of release the album debuted in the Billboard Top 200 in the #18 chart position promising great things. Billboard Magazine has predicted it could be “an even bigger hit” than it’s predecessor which remains in the Top Five of the Traditional Jazz Chart.\r\n\r\nJoining Chris on To Love Again are guest vocalists Sting ("What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?"), Paula Cole ("My One And Only Love"), Michael Bublé ("Let There Be Love"), Jill Scott ("Good Morning Heartache"), Paul Buchanan ("Are You Lonesome Tonight?"), Gladys Knight ("Lover Man"), Renee Olstead ("Pennies From Heaven"), Rosa Passos ("Here Comes That Rainy Day"), and, yes, that Steven Tyler (on Charlie Chaplin''s "Smile"). Rounding out To Love Again are the instrumental tracks "What''s New?" "I''ll Be Seeing You," "Embraceable You," and "To Love Again." As on his last album, Chris Botti is joined once again by the London Session Orchestra, who provide lush tonal coloration to the album''s arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe Dual Disc edition of To Love Again features exclusive behind-the-scenes footage on the "Making of" the album along with interviews and studio performances and more.\r\n\r\nTo Love Again follows the extraordinary success of Botti''s groundbreaking last album, When I Fall In Love, which has sold more than 500,000 copies to-date.\r\n\r\nReleased on September 28, 2004, When I Fall In Love tapped into the record-buying public''s desire for classic romantic jazz sounds, quickly hitting the #1 slot on both the Traditional Jazz albums sales chart and the Top Jazz overall album sales chart. When I Fall In Love debuted at #1 on the Traditional Jazz Album Sales chart and spent an incredible 17 weeks at #1 (including a spectacular 14 consecutive week run in the top slot). Botti''s When I Fall In Love also spent four weeks as the #1 album on the Jazz Overall Album Sales chart.\r\n\r\nShortly after the album''s release, When I Fall In Love jumped an astounding 109 spots--from #146 (week ending 11/14) to #37 (week ending 11/21) on the Top 200, the biggest single week''s sales leap of any traditional jazz album recorded by an instrumental artist to be released in the SoundScan era.\r\n\r\nBotti''s association with Sting--who sings with Botti on both To Love Again and When I Fall In Love--dates back to 1999, when the trumpeter joined the pop legend''s band as featured soloist on the "Brand New Day" tour, which lasted two-and-a-half years. Veteran of both the contemporary jazz world and mainstream pop studio scene, Botti has worked with Joni Mitchell, Natalie Merchant, and renowned film composer John Barry, among others. Film critic Rex Reed has called him "the sexiest trumpeter since Chet Baker." Botti joined Paul Simon''s band in 1990, where he remained for the next five years, and, in 1995, he recorded his solo debut, First Wish. After scoring the 1996 film "Caught," Botti returned in 1997 with his second LP, Midnight Without You, which was followed by Slowing Down the World two years later. His 2002 watershed album, Night Sessions, peaked at #2 on the Top Contemporary Jazz Albums chart while his seasonal collection, December, released the same year, hit #7 on the same chart.\r\n\r\nReleased in September 2003, A Thousand Kisses Deep entered at #20 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart and hit the #3 position on the Contemporary Jazz chart.\r\n\r\nAbout The Artist\r\n\r\nChris Botti is a native of Oregon who was born in Portland and grew up in Corvallis. His earliest musical influence was his mother, a classically trained pianist and part-time piano teacher. "I can''t really sit down and play a song on the piano," Chris admits. "But I know harmony, and generally I compose on the piano rather than on the trumpet." He pursued his music studies with a succession of outstanding teachers: David Friesen in the Northwest, Dave Baker in Indiana, and--following Botti''s move to New York City in 1986--the late trumpet master Woody Shaw.\r\n\r\n"After I came to New York," Chris recalls, "I realized I didn''t want to be a jazz musician. I love improvising, but you really need to live the bebop tradition in order to play it. That kind of music--the kind that Woody Shaw, for example, played so brilliantly--just moves a little too quickly for me.\r\n\r\n"The music that really inspired me as a teenager was more like Miles Davis playing ballads with the second Quintet. You know that spacey thing, when they broke down all the chords in the song? That band playing ''Stella By Starlight'' is something very different from, say, Bud Powell playing the same tune.\r\n\r\n"My music is more reined-in, because it''s in a pop format. But this atmospheric quality is what I really loved about jazz, and I''ve tried to marry that feel to the textures and melodies you might hear on a record by Peter Gabriel or Bryan Ferry."\r\n\r\nWhen Paul Simon set out on a 15-month world tour in 1990, Chris became a key sideman in a backing group that combined Brazilian and African players with New York session veterans like Randy Brecker, Richard Tee, and Steve Gadd. Botti''s solo debut, First Wish, was released in 1995; his second effort, Midnight Without You (a collaboration with English ambient pop group the Blue Nile) appeared in 1997 and was followed by Slowing Down The World in 1999. The Academy Award-winning film composer John Barry cast Chris as the featured soloist in his orchestral score Playing By Heart; Chris himself composed and performed the score for the Robert M. Young film "Caught."\r\n\r\nIn the studio and on stage, Chris Botti worked with such leading singer-songwriters as Marc Cohn, Joni Mitchell and Natalie Merchant; as a sideman, he has appeared on dozens of albums, compilations and soundtracks. In 2000, Chris joined Sting for two years of roadwork, as the featured soloist with the latter''s "Brand New Day" band. That tour culminated in Tuscany, where the concert was taped, later to become Sting''s first live CD in 15 years. "Sting in Tuscany: All This Time" aired as a part of the A&E In Concert series, garnering six Emmy nominations in the process. The documentary was later released on DVD. Chris became a part of a dramatic and memorable performance on that fateful day in the fall, September 11, 2001.\r\n\r\nWorking with band mate and multi-instrumentalist Kipper, Chris''s Columbia label debut Night Sessions--inspired by the sounds of the late-night European club scene--was written and recorded during a two and a half-month hiatus between Sting tours. The album became a breakthrough contemporary jazz hit upon its release in October 2001. A Columbia DVD, Night Sessions – Live In Concert, was issued in August 2002. Taped live at the historic El Rey Theater in Los Angeles, "Chris Botti and Friends" featured the trumpeter with his own expert road band plus guest appearances by Sting and Shawn Colvin.\r\n\r\nIn October 2002, Chris released the holiday theme album December. This 13-track collection combined joyful interpretations of seasonal standards ("Little Drummer Boy," "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing") with contemporary songs in the Christmas spirit, including Leonard Cohen''s "Hallelujah" and "Perfect Day" by Richard Marx. On the promotional trail in support of December, Botti appeared on "The Caroline Rhea Show" (WB network). He was invited to return the next day…then promptly hired as Rhea''s on-air partner, chatting with the host at the start of every show and frequently sitting in with a house band led by bassist Tim LeFebvre. Before he knew it, it was May 2003 and Chris had been part of "The Caroline Rhea Show" for five months.\r\n\r\nThe end came not a moment too soon as Chris headed into the recording studio to record his next Columbia release\r\n\r\nA Thousand Kisses Deep. On this CD, Chris started to show his affinity to the “classics”, recording a now renowned arrangement of the Miles Davis classic My Funny Valentine. The reaction to this performance – both on disc and live – made Chris realize his next album would do well to focus on the repertoire of the great American songbook. When I Fall in Love was recorded in Los Angeles and London in 2004 and produced by veteran Bobby Colomby. Working with some of the most accomplished arrangers and orchestrators around it has been hailed as “an instant classic” by many and continues to sell well nearly a year after it’s release. Botti’s big break came when he was “discovered” by Oprah Winfrey, who quickly championed his artistry to her audience, presenting him on her show in November of 2004. Within a week of his performance he had sold more than 50,000 CD’s and has not stopped since - maintaining it’s top five presence on the charts all the while.\r\n\r\nBotti has outdone himself with the release of his latest album: To Love Again. Employing nine of this era’s finest vocalists, relying on sublime orchestral arrangements, and once again under the direction of producer Bobby Colomby, this album has fulfilled the highest expectations. www.chrisbotti.com', 'chris_botti.jpg', 'http://www.chrisbotti.com/us/home'),

At times OTIS can make you weep with a joyous tear on ballads like “Little Bird” and “The Queen Mary” but then twist back to Americana pop songs with “Parachute” and “It’s Called Love.” Keeping the album as stripped down as possible allows Jer to show off his wonderful ability of crafting infectious sing-a-long tunes while telling beautiful and heartfelt stories.\r\n\r\nLike Petty and Dylan who came before him and Ryan Bingham and Ray LaMontagne who are doing it now, he is telling his tales through his music and becoming an international artist – having performed in the UK, Scotland and Australia while adding more countries to his calendar this spring. Throughout his travels e’s played legendary venues like The Vogue Theater in Indianapolis, the Exit/In and The Basement in Nashville, the Troubadour in London, the Winton Outback Festival in Winton, Australia and many others – sharing his stories/music around the globe.', 'jer_gregg.jpg', 'http://www.jergregg.com/'),
(25, 'GRiZ', 'GRiZ: "A true pioneer and master of musical expression, GriZ (Grant Kwiecinski) stands head-and-shoulders above the competition in terms of the sheer variety of his ever-evolving technical prowess. A tremendously passionate and soulful producer, GriZ has a peerless knack for creating profoundly engaging melodies to offset the presence of his phenomenally designed bass. Where many artists become mired in a over-simplified and standardized method of production for the sake of creative efficiency; GriZ has no qualms sacrificing speed for the sake of quality, technical diversity, and an unrelenting devotion to progress and dynamism. Beginning his saga as a producer at the young age of fourteen, it is immediately evident that his talent and devotion will lead him on a journey of exceptional musical diversity and exploration. From funky rhythms to jazzy melodic embellishment, GriZ effortlessly incorporates his instrumental zeal for the saxophone with his lifelong dedication to soulful, laser-infused beat-making. This is only the beginning for Grant, and already the stylistic range of his material is both inspirational and utterly awe-inspiring." -Written by Ethan Baer (SubSynthesis.com)', 'griz.jpg', NULL),

(31, 'Third Eye Blind', 'Although often lumped into the post-grunge category, Third Eye Blind sported a brighter sound than many of their late-''90s peers, taking as much influence from classic pop/rock traditions as the angst-ridden music that dominated the decade. The group scored its first hit in 1997, when the debut single "Semi-Charmed Life" cracked the Top 10. Third Eye Blind built upon that success throughout the following three years, releasing a number of singles (three of which cracked the Top 10) while touring with the likes of U2 and Oasis. After taking a break during the early 2000s, the band returned in 2009 with its fourth studio album, Ursa Major.\r\n\r\nThird Eye Blind hails from San Francisco, where singer Stephan Jenkins made his name as a solo musician after earning an English degree from the University of California at Berkeley. Jenkins soon decided to piece a band together. After several lineups failed to gel, former Fungo Mungo bassist Arion Salazar joined the group, which Jenkins had named Third Eye Blind (in reference to the metaphysical concept of a mind''s eye). At one of the band''s early shows, guitarist Kevin Cadogan -- a former student of Joe Satriani who later became involved in the northern California ska and punk scenes -- introduced himself to Jenkins. Cadogan subsequently joined Third Eye Blind in late 1995, bringing along former Counting Crows drummer Brad Hargreaves, as well.\r\n\r\nAs Third Eye Blind worked on cementing its sound, Jenkins began earning major-label attention through his production of the Braids'' cover of Queen''s "Bohemian Rhapsody," which became an international hit. He signed a publishing deal shortly afterward, reported to be the largest such deal ever presented to an unreleased artist. Meanwhile, Third Eye Blind cultivated a dedicated fan base by playing the Bay Area frequently, and the group''s original 14-song demo attracted attention from major labels. The buzz was continuing to build when the musicians finagled their way into a prized opening slot for Oasis'' April 1996 concert at the Civic Auditorium. The group was still unsigned at the time, but following their well-received performance (which included an encore -- a rare opportunity for an opening band), Third Eye Blind became the subject of a bidding war.\r\n\r\nThe band eventually signed with Elektra/Asylum, a label that afforded them a considerable degree of artistic freedom. Jenkins was tapped as the band''s producer and received a production deal to help develop new groups, but his top priority remained with Third Eye Blind. With Jenkins handling production studies, the band recorded their eponymous debut in San Francisco with the assistance of Eric Valentine, an engineer who had also worked on their early demos. The self-titled Third Eye Blind was released in the spring of 1997; by that summer, the introductory single "Semi-Charmed Life" had become a chart-topping modern rock hit. Spawning several more successful singles (including "How''s It Going to Be" and "Jumper"), the album broke into the Billboard Top 200 and remained there for over a year, establishing Third Eye Blind as one of the most popular bands of the late ''90s.\r\n\r\nBlue followed in 1999 and sold 150,000 copies within a month of its release. Although fans heralded it as the band''s strongest album, only one song -- the sprightly "Never Let You Go" -- matched the success of the band''s past singles. Tours across the globe followed throughout 2000, but by the time 2001 rolled around, the band had lost a crucial member (guitarist Cadogan, who co-wrote much of the band''s material before exiting the lineup) and opted for some time off. Tony Fredianelli soon climbed aboard as the band''s replacement guitarist, and Third Eye Blind turned its attention to several charity events. They played shows in support of the Tiger Woods Foundation and helped organize Breathe, a performance that promoted breast cancer awareness.\r\n\r\nBy 2003, Third Eye Blind resumed their schedule with the release of Out of the Vein. The record suffered from poor marketing, due in part to Elektra''s merger with Atlantic, and Out of the Vein ultimately failed to ignite the same commercial sparks as its predecessor. Nonetheless, the band returned to the drawing board that same year, although Jenkins'' lengthy battle with writer''s block prolonged the release of a new album for six years. In the interim, a best-of compilation entitled A Collection appeared in 2006, and the band continued to tour in support of their past releases. Third Eye Blind''s long-awaited fourth album, Ursa Major, was issued in 2009, preceded one year earlier by the digital EP Red Star.', 'third_eye_blind.jpg', 'http://thirdeyeblind.com/'),

They''ve created an album that has "the light, poppy quality of British bands Keane or The Script -- which has done plenty of damage on the airwaves -- but with more detail in the songwriting," says the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\r\n\r\nProduced by Paul Barber (My Favorite Highway, The Bigger Lights, The Friday Night Boys), Shifting is the manifestation of the band''s musical exploration and growth since the last record. "These guys can play," notes Barber, "that''s what made the sessions really rewarding." Beyond the quartet''s growth as musicians, the theme of ''shifting'' appears in the underlying emphasis on change in the songs, Eicher''s evolution as a songwriter, and the band''s ability to shift seamlessly between various styles, giving the album a "mainstream likability that is both charming and contagious," praises the Herald-Standard.\r\n\r\n"With the release of Shifting, JD Eicher & the Goodnights take their place among the elite of Northeast Ohio-Western Pennsylvania bands," exclaims The Vindicator.

Nick quickly learned the original material and the three set out to record their first release "Resurface" in February of 2009. It took several months to mix the project and in the meantime the group was touring around the Midwest and as far as Lake Tahoe, CA.
